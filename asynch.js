//javascript is synchronous
// sync is one code is executed then the next cod ei executed
//single threaded language
// javascript is found in run time environment and not alone so it does not choke even if it is run on single threading
//line is run one by one
// each operation waits for the last one to the next line

// blocking code vs non blocking code
//asynchronous code and synchronous code 

// blocking code and non blocking code 

//blocking code block the flow of program / read file sync
//

//non blocking code
//read file asynchronous 

// is non blocking code best??
//we get user data and store in database// fro ex u give user a success message when the database is still dealing with the database

// everything depends on the use case

//javascript engine ---> execution context 
//wep api
//node

//task queue
//promise queue or high priority queue
// whenever a program is executed  a call stack is created in which we have the global execution context and one by one the functions are loaded 
//memory heap
//problem with async
//first do this task and then remind me later for that we use web api

//setTimeout

//fetch promise queue has a high priority
